# Fullstack Open 2019
### University of Helsinki - Department of Computer Science

This is a git repository for exercises of the course Fullstack Open 2019. The repository follows the suggested form, where every sub section of the course (osa0, osa1, ...) is separated to its own subfolder under the course repository. 

The subfolder **osaN** contains:
* **README_osaN.md**: sort notes of the week's exercises
* Exercises of the week, where every individual exercise series is placed inside its own subfolder
